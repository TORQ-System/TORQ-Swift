TORQ is a project requirement for <b>SWE 444</b> <em>Construction Labrotory</em> course. An iOS application aiming to help individuals injured due to road accidents receive medical attention as soon as possible by reporting the incident to the nearest health center through firing a request triggered by sensors attached to the vehicle detecting impact and inclination. In this context, a request is the alert that includes the injured person’s information (medical record/personal information) along with his/her geolocation. The request is then displayed on the center’s portal where its available for the paramedic.

TORQ puts fourth user’s health. Therefore, users are able to initiate their own SOS requests and have a one-to-one chat with their assigned paramedic. As theses SOS requests can stem from many factors, users shall have the ability to be instructed on how to perform first aid and how to go about the situation depending on the request circumstance. The application offers capabilities catering to users’ need as it eases their communication with health authorities.
